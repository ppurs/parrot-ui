## About

### Motivation

**Parrot** is addressed to people who struggle with learning foreign languages and need a tool that will enable them to save newly learned vocabulary or phrases, as well as regularly repeat them to increase and check the state of their knowledge. As the number of new words increases over time,
learners also need the ability to put the expressions into categoires, which is especially important when they are studying for a test/exam or simply want to introduce variety into the learning process and each day
train a different set.

### Functionalities

As a user, after sign up to the application, you can:

:heavy_check_mark: create your own sets of terms for each pair of languages\
:heavy_check_mark: switch languages\
:heavy_check_mark: create labels for each set, and add them to words independently\
:heavy_check_mark: take part in quiz\
:heavy_check_mark: select quiz strategy

.. and many more!
